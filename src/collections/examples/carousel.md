This carousel is built with Metalsmith collections. It pulls the image url and text from a collection of markdown files and uses bootstrap-carousel.html template to print all the markup. For the sake of brevity the markup for the carousel indicators and slides is in this same template but could conceivably be broken out into their own templates.
