KalaStatic

[KalaStatic](https://github.com/kalamuna/kalastatic-cli) is a static site framework for prototyping and building out websites.

Its primary purpose is to put into practice [atomic web design](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design) principles to produce a [living styleguide](http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2014/09/how-to-make-your-code-easily-maintainable-with-living-style-guides) that can be used to guide back-end implementations in a framework agnostic approach. As such, it serves as a point of convergence between front-end development, back-end development, and content strategy.

Style guide: kalastatic
