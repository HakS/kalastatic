Kalastatic is a prototyping framework.

It can be (and has been) used to build beautifully crafted static sites at [Kalamuna](https://www.kalamuna.com)."

However, its primary purpose is to put into practice [atomic web design](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design) principles to produce a [living styleguide](http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2014/09/how-to-make-your-code-easily-maintainable-with-living-style-guides) that can be used to guide back-end implementations in a framework agnostic approach.

As such, it serves as a point of convergence between front-end development, back-end development, and content strategy.

We have [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org) in mind and are positioning the project to co-exist with Drupal themes â€“ in particular [Kalatheme](https://www.drupal.org/project/kalatheme).

_**Kalastatic** is currently experimental.
Development is not guaranteed backwards compatible at this time, and therefore not recommended for a production environment._


## Project Goals

1. Designers and front-end developers should soar in their expressivity by focusing on their craft instead of struggling with poorly documented CMS APIs and configurations.
1. Provide tangible assets for clients and agencies early in the process to drive design thinking while staying nimble.
1. Demonstrate content and support content strategy in-situ early in the process.
1. Provide a litmus test against style regressions during development.
1. Lower the technological barrier to crafting small sites for agency-style projects
