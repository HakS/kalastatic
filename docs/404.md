# Handling 404 pages

## For Apache or nginx

1. Customize the `src/404.md` file
2. Ensure `assets/.htaccess` is configured properly
3. Check `index.php` to ensure it's delivering `index.html`

**note** you won't see the 404 page on your local at http://localhost:8000/404 with this approach currently, as this is running a node server. Another method would need to be concocted.
