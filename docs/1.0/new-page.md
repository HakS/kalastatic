# Creating a new page

In order to create a new page you must create a new markdown file inside /src. Here's an example from the team page:

```
---
template: team.html
title: Team KalaStatic
---

## Team Kalastatic is ecstatic

We are of one mind and heart, with a mission to create the most awesome static site generator in the world! Or not, whatever.
```

You must at least set the template file that this page will use and you can optionally add other parameters that will become available to print in the template.
