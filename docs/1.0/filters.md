## Limit
We implement a custom swig filter that limits output to a certain length. This is useful for teasers and the like. It clips at the last period or space before the limit and appends an ellipsis (â€¦)

It can be used in the following ways:
```
    // Defaults to 140 characters because Twitter.
    <p>{{contents|limit)}}</p>
```

```
    // Limit to a specific number of characters.
    <p>{{contents|limit(200)}}</p>
```

Note that you will probably want to use the `limit` filter in combination with the `safe` filter in order that markup gets rendered instead of printed out.

```
    // Usable with other filters.
    <p>{{contents|safe|limit(100)}}</p>
```
